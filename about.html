        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Liza Riabova. I'm a high school student and I created this website as a project for my computer science class. I'm currently learning the basics of web development and enjoying every bit of it. This project is a reflection of my passion for coding and creativity. I'm excited to share my journey as I continue to explore the world of programming and design.</p>
